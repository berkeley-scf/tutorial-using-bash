<h1>Using the bash shell</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>

<p>Some of the material in this tutorial was adapted from Chris
Paciorek&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2014/blob/master/units/unit2-bash.pdf">2014 Statistics 243 lecture notes on
Bash</a>
and his <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2014/blob/master/units/unit4-usingR.pdf">2014 Statistics 243 lecture notes on using
R</a>.</p>

<p>Before reading this, you will want to be familiar with the material in
the &ldquo;Basics of UNIX&rdquo; tutorial and screencast here:
<a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials">http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>1) The Interactive Shell</h2>

<p>The shell is an interactive computer programming environment. More
specifically, it is a read-evaluate-print loop (REPL) environment. R and
Python also provide REPL environments. A REPL reads a single
<em>expression</em> or input, parses and <em>evaluates</em> it, <em>prints</em> the results,
and then <em>loops</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>

<p>I will use a <code>$</code> prompt for bash, a <code>&gt;</code> prompt for R, a <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> for
Python, and a <code>In [1]:</code> prompt for IPython. By convention, a regular
user&#39;s prompt in bash is <code>$</code>, while the root (or administrative)
user&#39;s prompt is <code>#</code>. However, it is common practice to never log on
as the root user. If you need to run a command with root privileges,
you should use the <code>sudo</code> command (see the <em>Getting started</em> section
below for more details).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you are working in a terminal window (i.e., a window with the
command line interface), you&#39;re interacting with a shell. There are
multiple shells (e.g., <em>sh</em>, <em>bash</em>, <em>csh</em>, <em>tcsh</em>, <em>zsh</em>, <em>fish</em>). I&#39;ll
assume you are using <em>bash</em>, as this is the default for Mac OS X, the
BCE VM, the SCF machines and most Linux distributions. However, the
basic ideas are applicable to any Unix shell.</p>

<p>The shell is an amazingly powerful programming environment. From it you
can interactively monitor and control almost any aspect of the OS and
more importantly you can automate it. As you will see, <strong>bash</strong> has a
very extensive set of capabilities intended to make both interactive as
well as automated control simple, effective, and customizable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>

<p>It can be difficult to distinguish what is shell-specific and what is
just part of UNIX. Some of the material here is not bash-specific but
general to UNIX.</p>

<p>Reference: Newham and Rosenblatt, Learning the bash Shell, 2nd ed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>1.1) Getting started</h3>

<p>I assume you already have access to a basic bash shell on a computer
with network access (e.g., the Terminal on a Mac, the Ubuntu subsystem on Windows, or a Linux machine). You should also have ssh installed. SSH provides an
encrypted mechanism to connect to a remote Unix-based (i.e., Linux or Mac) terminal. To learn more
about using ssh to connect to the SCF machines and general tips about
using ssh on various operating systems, see:
<a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/ssh">http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/ssh</a></p>

<p>To ssh to another machine, you need to know its (host)name. For example,
to ssh to <code>arwen.berkeley.edu</code>, one of the SCF machines, you would:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh arwen.berkeley.edu
Password:
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you have to type your password. Alternatively, you can set
up ssh so that you can use it without typing your password. To learn how
to set this up, see: <a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/ssh-keys">http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/ssh-keys</a></p>

<p>If you have a different username on SCF machines, you will need to
specify it as well. For example, to specify the username <code>jarrod</code>, you
would:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh jarrod@arwen.berkeley.edu
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to view graphical applications on your local computer that
are running on the remote computer you need to use the <code>-X</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh -X jarrod@arwen.berkeley.edu
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you want to copy a file (<code>file1.txt</code>) from your local
computer to <code>arwen.berkeley.edu</code>, you can use the <code>scp</code> command,
which securely copies files between machines:</p>

<pre><code>$ scp file1.txt jarrod@arwen.berkeley.edu:.
</code></pre>

<p>The above command will copy <code>file1.txt</code> from my current working
directory on my local machine to <code>jarrod</code>&#39;s home directory on
<code>arwen.berkeley.edu</code>. The <code>.</code> following the <code>:</code> indicates that I want
to copy the file to my home directory on the remote machine. I could
also replace <code>.</code> with any relative path from my home directory on the
remote machine or I could use an absolute path.</p>

<p>To copy a file (<code>file2.txt</code>) from <code>arwen.berkeley.edu</code> to my local
machine:</p>

<pre><code>$ scp jarrod@arwen.berkeley.edu:file2.txt .
</code></pre>

<p>I can even copy a file (<code>file3.txt</code>) owned by one user (<code>jarrod</code>) on one
remote machine <code>arwen.berkeley.edu</code> to the account of another user
(<code>jmillman</code>) on another remote machine <code>scf-ug02.berkeley.edu</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ scp jarrod@arwen.berkeley.edu:file3.txt jmillman@arwen.berkeley.edu:.
</code></pre>

<p>If instead of copying a single file, I wanted to copy an entire
directory (<code>src</code>) from one machine to another, I would use the <code>-r</code>
option:</p>

<pre><code>$ scp -r src jmillman@arwen.berkeley.edu:.
</code></pre>

<p>Regardless of whether you are working on a local computer or a remote
one, it is occasionally useful to operate as a different user. For
instance, you may need root (or administrative) access to change file
permissions or install software. (Note this will only be possible
on machines that you own or have special privileges on; the Ubuntu
subsystem for windows is one way to have a virtual Linux machine
for which you have root access.)</p>

<p>For example on an Ubuntu Linux machine (including the Ubuntu subsystem for Windows),
here&#39;s how you can act as the &#39;root&#39; user to update or add software
on machines where you have administrative access:</p>

<p>To upgrade all the software on the machine:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>To install the text editor vim on the machine:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install vim
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>tip</strong></p>

<p>Most bash commands have electronic manual pages, which are accessible
directly from the commandline. You will be more efficient and
effective if you become accustomed to using these <code>man</code> pages. To view
the <code>man</code> page for the command <code>sudo</code>, for instance, you would type:</p>

<pre><code>$ man sudo
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>1.2) Variables</h3>

<p>Much of how bash behaves can be customized through the use of variables,
which consists of names that have values assigned to them. To access the
value currently assigned to a variable, you can prepend the name with
the dollar sign ($). To print the value you can use the <code>echo</code> command.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is my default shell?</p>

<p><code>$ echo $SHELL</code></p></li>
<li><p>To change to bash on a one-time basis:</p>

<p><code>$ bash</code></p></li>
<li><p>To make it your default:</p>

<p><code>$ chsh /bin/bash</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the last example, <code>/bin/bash</code> should be whatever the path to the bash
shell is, which you can figure out using <code>which bash</code>.</p>

<p>To declare a variable, just assign a value to its reference. For
example, if you want to make a new variable with the name <code>counter</code> with
the value <code>1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ counter=1
</code></pre>

<p>Since bash uses spaces to parse the expression you give it as input, it
is important to note the lack of spaces around the equal sign. Try
typing the command with and without spaces and note what happens.</p>

<p>You can also enclose the variable name in curly brackets, which comes in
handy when you&#39;re embedding a variable within a line of code to make
sure the shell knows where the variable name ends:</p>

<pre><code>$ base=/home/jarrod/
$ echo $basesrc
$ echo ${base}src
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you understand the difference in behavior in the last two
lines.</p>

<p>There are also special shell variables called environment variables that
help to control the shell&#39;s behavior. These are generally named in all
caps. Type <code>printenv</code> to see them. You can create your own environment
variable as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ export base=/home/jarrod/
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>export</code> command ensures that other shells created by the current
shell (for example, to run a program) will inherit the variable. Without
the export command, any shell variables that are set will only be
modified within the current shell. More generally, if you want a
variable to always be accessible, you should include the definition of
the variable with an <code>export</code> command in your <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>

<p>You can control the appearance of the bash prompt using the <code>PS1</code>
variable:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo $PS1
</code></pre>

<p>To modify it so that it puts the username, hostname, and current working
directory in the prompt:</p>

<pre><code>$ export PS1=&#39;[\u@\h \W]\$ &#39;
[user1@local1 ~]$ 
</code></pre>

<h3>1.3) Commands</h3>

<p>While each command has its own syntax, there are some rules usually
followed. Generally, a command line consists of 4 things: a command,
command options, arguments, and line acceptance. Consider the following
example:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, <code>ls</code> is the command, <code>-l</code> is a command option
specifying to use the long format, <code>file.txt</code> is the argument, and the
line acceptance is indicated by hitting the <code>Enter</code> key at the end of
the line.</p>

<p>After you type a command at the bash prompt and indicate line acceptance
with the <code>Enter</code> key, bash parses the command and then attempts to
execute the command. To determine what to do, bash first checks whether
the command is a shell function (we will discuss functions below). If
not, it checks to see whether it is a builtin. Finally, if the command
is not a shell function nor a builtin, bash uses the <code>PATH</code> variable.
The <code>PATH</code> variable is a list of directories:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/home/jarrod/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:
</code></pre>

<p>For example, consider the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep pdf file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>We will discuss <code>grep</code> later. For now, let&#39;s ignore what <code>grep</code> actually
does and focus on what bash would do when you press enter after typing
the above command. First bash checks whether <code>grep</code> a shell function or
a builtin. Once it determines that <code>grep</code> is neither a shell function
nor a builtin, it will look for an executable file named <code>grep</code> first in
<code>/home/jarrod/usr/bin</code>, then in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, and so on until it
finds a match or runs out of places to look. You can use <code>which</code> to find
out where bash would find it:</p>

<pre><code>$ which grep
/bin/grep
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Consider the following examples using the <code>ls</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls --all -l
$ ls -a -l
$ ls -al
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>man ls</code> to see what the command options do. Is there any difference
in what the three versions of the command invocation above return as the
result? What happens if you add a filename to the end of the command?</p>

<h4>1.3.1) Tab completion</h4>

<p>When working in the shell, it is often unnecessary to type out an entire
command or file name, because of a feature known as tab completion. When
you are entering a command or filename in the shell, you can, at any
time, hit the tab key, and the shell will try to figure out how to
complete the name of the command or filename you are typing. If there is
only one command in the search path and you&#39;re using tab completion with
the first token of a line, then the shell will display its value and the
cursor will be one space past the completed name. If there are multiple
commands that match the partial name, the shell will display as much as
it can. In this case, hitting tab twice will display a list of choices,
and redisplay the partial command line for further editing. Similar
behavior with regard to filenames occurs when tab completion is used on
anything other than the first token of a command.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>

<p>Note that R does tab completion for objects (including functions) and
filenames. While the default Python shell does not perform tab
completion, the IPython shell does.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>1.3.2) Command History and Editing</h4>

<p>By using the up and down arrows, you can scroll through commands that
you have entered previously. So if you want to rerun the same command,
or fix a typo in a command you entered, just scroll up to it and hit
enter to run it or edit the line and then hit enter.</p>

<p>To list the history of the commands you entered, use the <code>history</code>
command:</p>

<pre><code>$ history
  1    echo $PS1
  2    PS1=$
  3    bash
  4    export PS1=$
  5    bash
  6    echo $PATH
  7    which echo
  8    ls --all -l
  9    ls -a -l
  10   ls -al
  11   ls -al manual.xml
</code></pre>

<p>The behavior of the <code>history</code> command is controlled by a shell
variables:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo $HISTFILE
$ echo $HISTSIZE
</code></pre>

<p>You can also rerun previous commands as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ !-n 
$ !gi
</code></pre>

<p>The first example runs the nth previous command and the second one runs
the last command that started with &#39;gi&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>Table. Command History Expansion</strong></p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>^string1^string2</code></td>
<td align="left">Execute the previous command with <em>string2</em> substituted for <em>string1</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If you&#39;re not sure what command you&#39;re going to recall, you can append
<code>:p</code> at the end of the text you type to do the recall, and the result
will be printed, but not executed. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ !gi:p
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use the up arrow key to bring back that statement for
editing or execution.</p>

<p>You can also search for commands by doing <code>Ctrl-r</code> and typing a string
of characters to search for in the search history. You can hit return to
submit, <code>Ctrl-c</code> to get out, or <code>ESC</code> to put the result on the regular
command line for editing.</p>

<h4>1.3.3) Command Substitution</h4>

<p>You may occasionally need to substitute the results of a command for use
by another command. For example, if you wanted to use the directory
listing returned by <code>ls</code> as the argument to another command, you would
type <code>$(ls)</code> in the location you want the result of <code>ls</code> to appear.</p>

<p>An older notation for command substitution is to use backticks (e.g.,
<code>`ls`</code> versus <code>$(ls)</code>). It is generally preferable to use the new
notation, since there are many annoyances with the backtick notation.
For example, backslashes (<code>\</code>) inside of backticks behave in a
non-intuitive way, nested quoting is more cumbersome inside backticks,
nested substitution is more difficult inside of backticks, and it is
easy to visually mistake backticks for a single quote.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Try the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l tr
$ which tr
$ ls -l which tr
$ ls -l $(which tr)
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you understand why each command behaves as it does.</p>

<h3>1.4) Shortcuts</h3>

<h4>1.4.1) Aliases &ndash; command shortcuts</h4>

<p>Aliases allow you to use an abbreviation for a command, to create new
functionality or to insure that certain options are always used when you
call an existing command. For example, I&#39;m lazy and would rather type
<code>q</code> instead of <code>exit</code> to terminate a shell window. You could create the
alias as follow:</p>

<pre><code>$ alias q=exit
</code></pre>

<p>As another example, suppose you find the <code>-F</code> option of <code>ls</code> (which
displays <code>/</code> after directories, <code>\</code> after executable files and <code>@</code> after
links) to be very useful. The command :</p>

<pre><code>$ alias ls=&quot;ls -F&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>will insure that the <code>-F</code> option will be used whenever you use <code>ls</code>. If
you need to use the unaliased version of something for which you&#39;ve
created an alias, precede the name with a backslash (<code>\</code>). For example,
to use the normal version of <code>ls</code> after you&#39;ve created the alias
described above:</p>

<pre><code>$ \ls
</code></pre>

<p>The real power of aliases is only achieved when they are automatically
set up whenever you log in to the computer or open a new shell window.
To achieve that goal with aliases (or any other bash shell commands),
simply insert the commands in the file <code>.bashrc</code> in your home directory.
For example, here is an excerpt from my <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code># .bashrc

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
        . /etc/bashrc
fi

# User specific aliases and functions
pushdp () {
 pushd &quot;$(python -c &quot;import os.path as _, ${1}; \
   print _.dirname(_.realpath(${1}.__file__[:-1]))&quot;
 )&quot;
}

export EDITOR=vim
source /usr/share/git-core/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh
export PS1=&#39;[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 &quot; (%s)&quot;)]\$ &#39;

# history settings
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups   # no duplicate entries
shopt -s histappend             # append, don&#39;t overwrite

# R settings
export R_LIBS=$HOME/usr/lib64/R/library
alias R=&quot;/usr/bin/R --quiet --no-save&quot;

# Set path
mybin=$HOME/usr/bin
export PATH=$mybin:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/usr/local/bin:$PATH:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/usr/local/lib

# Additional aliases  
alias grep=&#39;grep --color=auto&#39;
alias hgrep=&#39;history | grep&#39;
alias l.=&#39;ls -d .* --color=auto&#39;
alias ll=&#39;ls -l --color=auto&#39;
alias ls=&#39;ls --color=auto&#39;
alias more=less
alias vi=vim
alias which=&#39;(alias; declare -f) | /usr/bin/which --tty-only \
         --read-alias --read-functions --show-tilde --show-dot&#39;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Look over the content of the example <code>.bashrc</code> and make sure you
understand what each line does. For instance, use <code>man grep</code> to see what
the option <code>--color=auto</code> does. Use <code>man which</code> to figure out what the
various options passed to it do.</p>

<h4>1.4.2) Keyboard shortcuts</h4>

<p>Note that you can use emacs-like control sequences (<code>Ctrl-a</code>, <code>Ctrl-e</code>,
<code>Ctrl-k</code>) to navigate and delete characters.</p>

<h2>2) Basic File Management</h2>

<p>In Unix, almost &ldquo;everything is a file.&rdquo; This means that a very wide
variety of input and output resources (e.g., documents, directories,
keyboards, harddrives, network devices) are streams of bytes available
through the filesystem interface. This means that the basic file
management tools are extremely powerful in Unix. Not only can you use
these tools to work with files, but you can also use them to monitor and
control many aspects of your computer.</p>

<h3>2.1) Files</h3>

<p>A file typically consist of these attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Name.</li>
<li>  Type.</li>
<li>  Location.</li>
<li>  Size.</li>
<li>  Protection.</li>
<li>  Time, date, and user identification.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../figs/file.png" alt="Schematic of file attributes."/></p>

<p>Listing file attributes with <code>ls</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l
</code></pre>

<p>Getting more information with <code>stat</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ stat manual.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Finding out what type of file you have:</p>

<pre><code>$ file manual.xml
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>tip</strong></p>

<p>The <code>file</code> command relies on many sources</p>

<p>:   of information to determine what a file contains. The easiest part
    to explain is <em>magic</em>. Specifically, the <code>file</code> command examines
    the content of the file and compares it with information found in
    the <code>/usr/share/magic/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Changing file attributes with <code>chmod</code>:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>$ chmod g+w manual.xml
</code></pre>

<h3>2.2) Navigation</h3>

<p>Efficient navigation of the filesystem from the shell is an essential
aspect of mastering Unix. Use <code>pwd</code> to list your current working
directory. If you just enter <code>cd</code> at a prompt, your current working
directory will change to your home directory. You can also refer to your
home directory using the tilde <code>~</code>. For example, if you wanted to change
your current directory to the subdirectory <code>src</code> in your home directory
from any other current directory, you could type:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/src
</code></pre>

<p>Also if you want to return to the previous directory, you could type:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd -
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the pushd, popd, and dirs commands if you would like to keep
a stack of previous working directories rather than just the last one.</p>

<h3>2.3) Filename Globbing</h3>

<p>Shell file globbing will expand certain special characters (called
wildcards) to match patterns of filenames, before passing those
filenames on to a program. Note that the programs themselves don&#39;t know
anything about wildcards; it is the shell that does the expansion, so
that programs don&#39;t see the wildcards. The following table shows some of
the special characters that the shell uses for expansion.</p>

<p><strong>Table. Filename wildcards</strong></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Wildcard</th>
<th align="left">Function</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>*</code></td>
<td align="left">Match zero or more characters.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>?</code></td>
<td align="left">Match exactly one character.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>List all files ending with a digit:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls *[0-9]
</code></pre>

<p>Make a copy of <code>filename</code> as <code>filename.old</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ cp filename{,.old}
</code></pre>

<p>Remove all files beginning with <em>a</em> or <em>z</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm [az]*
</code></pre>

<p>List all the R code files with a variety of suffixes:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls *.{r,q,R}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>echo</code> command can be used to verify that a wildcard expansion will
do what you think it will:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo cp filename{,.old}
cp filename filename.old
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to suppress the special meaning of a wildcard in a shell
command, precede it with a backslash (<code>\</code>). Note that this is a general
rule of thumb in many similar situations when a character has a special
meaning but you just want to treat it as a character.</p>

<p>To read more about standard globbing patterns, see the man page:</p>

<pre><code>$ man 7 glob
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Brace expansion is quite useful and more flexible than I&#39;ve indicated.
Above we saw how to use brace expansion using a comma comma separated
list of items inside the curly braces (e.g., <code>{r,q,R}</code>), but they can
also be used with a sequence specification. A sequence is indicated with
a start and end item separated by two periods (<code>..</code>). Try typing the
following examples at the command line and try to figure out how they
work:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo {1..15}
$ echo {a{1..3},b{1..5},c{c..e}}
$ echo {{d..a},{a..d}}
$ echo {{d..b},a,{b..d}}
$ echo {1..5..2}
$ echo {z..a..-2}
</code></pre>

<h3>2.4) Quoting</h3>

<p>Finally, a note about using single vs. double quotes in shell code. In
general, variables inside double quotes will be evaluated, but variables
not inside double quotes will not be:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo &quot;$HOME&quot;
/home/jarrod
$ echo &#39;$HOME&#39;
$HOME
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Table. Quotes</strong></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Types of Quoting</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>' '</code></td>
<td align="left">hard quote - no substitution allowed</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>&quot; &quot;</code></td>
<td align="left">soft quote - allow substitution</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>This can be useful, for example, when you have a directory with a space
in its name (of course, it is better to avoid spaces in file and
directory names). Since bash uses spaces to parse the elements of the
command line, you might try escaping the spaces with a backslash:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls $HOME/with\ space
file1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>However that can be a pain and may not work in all circumstances. A cleaner
approach is to use soft (or double) quotes:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls &quot;$HOME/with space&quot;
file1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>If you used hard quotes, you will get this error:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls &#39;$HOME/with space&#39;
ls: cannot access $HOME/with space: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>What if you have double quotes in your file or directory name (again, it
is better to avoid using double quotes in file and directory names)? In
this case, you will need to escape the quote:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls &quot;$HOME/\&quot;with\&quot;quote&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>So we&#39;ll generally use double quotes. We can always work with a literal
double quote by escaping it as seen above.</p>

<h3>2.5) Basic utilities</h3>

<p>Since files are such an essential aspect of Unix and working from the
shell is the primary way to work with Unix, there are a large number of
useful commands and tools to view and manipulate files.</p>

<ul>
<li>  cat &ndash; concatenate files and print on the standard output</li>
<li>  cp &ndash; copy files and directories</li>
<li>  cut &ndash;_remove sections from each line of files</li>
<li>  diff&ndash; find differences between two files</li>
<li>  grep &ndash; print lines matching a pattern</li>
<li>  head &ndash; output the first part of files</li>
<li>  find &ndash;  search for files in a directory hierarchy</li>
<li>  less &ndash; opposite of more (and better than more)</li>
<li>  more &ndash; file perusal filter for crt viewing</li>
<li>  mv &ndash; move (rename) files</li>
<li>  nl &ndash; number lines of files</li>
<li>  paste &ndash; merge lines of files</li>
<li>  rm &ndash; remove files or directories</li>
<li>  rmdir &ndash; remove empty directories</li>
<li>  sort &ndash; sort lines of text files.</li>
<li>  split &ndash; split a file into pieces</li>
<li>  tac &ndash; concatenate and print files in reverse</li>
<li>  tail &ndash; output the last part of files</li>
<li>  touch &ndash; change file timestamps</li>
<li>  tr &ndash; translate or delete characters</li>
<li>  uniq &ndash; remove duplicate lines from a sorted file</li>
<li>  wc &ndash; print the number of bytes, words, and lines in files</li>
<li>  wget and curl &ndash; non-interactive network downloader</li>
</ul>

<p>As we&#39;ve already seen the general syntax for a Unix program is:</p>

<pre><code>$ command -options argument1 argument2 ...
</code></pre>

<p>For example, :</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -i graphics file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>looks for the literal string <code>graphics</code> (argument 1) in <code>file.txt</code>
(argument2) with the option <code>-i</code>, which says to ignore the case of the
letters. While :</p>

<pre><code>$ less file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>simply pages through a text file (you can navigate up and down) so you
can get a feel for what&#39;s in it. To exit <code>less</code> type <code>q</code>.</p>

<p>To find files by name, modification time, and type:</p>

<pre><code>$ find . -name &#39;*.txt&#39;  # find files named *.txt
$ find . -mtime -2      # find files modified less than 2 days ago
$ find . -type l        # find links
</code></pre>

<p>Unix programs often take options that are identified with a minus
followed by a letter, followed by the specific option (adding a space
before the specific option is fine). Options may also involve two
dashes, e.g., <code>R --no-save</code>. A standard two dash option for many
commands is <code>--help</code>. For example, try:</p>

<pre><code>$ tail --help
</code></pre>

<p>Here are a couple of examples of using the <code>tail</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-using-bash/master/cpds.csv
$ tail -n 10 cpds.csv   # last 10 lines of cpds.csv
$ tail -f cpds.csv      # shows end of file, continually refreshing
</code></pre>

<p>The first line downloads the data from GitHub. The two main tools
for downloading network accessible data from the commandline are <code>wget</code>
and <code>curl</code>. I tend to use <code>wget</code> as my commandline downloading tool as
it is more convenient, but on a Mac, only <code>curl</code> is generally available.</p>

<p>A few more tidbits about <code>grep</code> (we will see more examples of <code>grep</code> in
the section on regular expressions, but it is so useful that it is worth
seeing many times):</p>

<pre><code>$ grep ^2001 cpds.csv   # returns lines that start with &#39;2001&#39;
$ grep 0$ cpds.csv      # returns lines that end with &#39;0&#39;
$ grep 19.0 cpds.csv    # returns lines with &#39;19&#39; separated from &#39;0&#39; by a single character
$ grep 19.*0 cpds.csv   # now separated by any number of characters
$ grep -o 19.0 cpds.csv # returns only the content matching the pattern from the relevant lines
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the first argument to grep is the pattern you are looking for.
The syntax is different from that used for wildcards in file names.
Also, you can use regular expressions in the pattern. We won’t see this
in detail here, but we will discuss this in the section below on regular
expressions.</p>

<p>It is sometimes helpful to put the pattern inside double quotes, e.g.,
if you want spaces in your pattern:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep &quot;George .* Bush&quot; cpds.csv
</code></pre>

<p>More generally in Unix, enclosing a string in quotes is often useful to
indicate that it is a single argument/value.</p>

<p>If you want to explicitly look for one of the special characters used in
creating patterns (such as double quote (<code>&quot;</code>), period (<code>.</code>), etc., you
can &ldquo;escape&rdquo; them by preceding with a back-slash. For example to look
for <code>&quot;Canada&quot;</code>, including the quotes:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep &quot;\&quot;Canada\&quot;&quot; cpds.csv
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a big data file and need to subset it by line (e.g., with
<code>grep</code>) or by field (e.g., with <code>cut</code>), then you can do it really fast
from the Unix command line, rather than reading it with R, SAS, Python,
etc.</p>

<p>Much of the power of these utilities comes in piping between them (see
the next section) and using wildcards (see the section on Globbing) to
operate on groups of files. The utilities can also be used in shell
scripts to do more complicated things.</p>

<p>We will look at several examples of how to use these utilities below,
but first let&#39;s discuss streams and redirection.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;ve already seen some of the above commands. Follow the links above
and while you are reading the abbreviated man pages consider how you
might use these commands.</p>

<h3>2.6) Streams, Pipes, and Redirects</h3>

<p>Unix programs that involve input and/or output often operate by reading
input from a stream known as standard input (<em>stdin</em>), and writing their
results to a stream known as standard output (<em>stdout</em>). In addition, a
third stream known as standard error (<em>stderr</em>) receives error messages
and other information that&#39;s not part of the program&#39;s results. In the
usual interactive session, standard output and standard error default to
your screen, and standard input defaults to your keyboard.</p>

<p>You can change the place from which programs read and write through
redirection. The shell provides this service, not the individual
programs, so redirection will work for all programs. The following table
shows some examples of redirection.</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that <code>cmd</code> may include options and arguments as seen in the
previous section.</p>

<h4>2.6.1) Standard Redirection</h4>

<p>Operations where output from one command is used as input to another
command (via the <code>|</code> operator) are known as pipes; they are made
especially useful by the convention that many UNIX commands will accept
their input through the standard input stream when no file name is
provided to them.</p>

<p>A simple pipe to <code>wc</code> to count the number of words in a string:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo &quot;hey there&quot; | wc -w
2
</code></pre>

<p>Translating lowercase to UPPERCASE with <code>tr</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo &#39;user1&#39;  | tr &#39;a-z&#39; &#39;A-Z&#39;
USER1
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of finding out how many unique entries there are in
the 2nd column of a data file whose fields are separated by commas:</p>

<pre><code>$ cut -d&#39;,&#39; -f2 cpds.csv | sort | uniq | wc
$ cut -d&#39;,&#39; -f2 cpds.csv | sort | uniq &gt; countries.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Above we use the <code>cut</code> utility to extract the second field (<code>-f2</code>) or
column of the file <code>cpds.csv</code> where the fields (or columns) are split or
delimited by a comma (<code>-d&#39;,&#39;</code>). The standard output of the <code>cut</code> command
is then piped (via <code>|</code>) to the standard input of the <code>sort</code> command.
Then the output of <code>sort</code> is sent to the input of <code>uniq</code> to remove
duplicate entries in the sorted list provided by <code>sort</code>. Rather than
using <code>sort | uniq</code>, you could also use <code>sort -u</code>. Finally, the first of
the <code>cut</code> commands prints a word count summary using <code>wc</code>; while the
second saving the sorted information with duplicates removed in the file
<code>countries.txt</code>.</p>

<p>To see if there are any &ldquo;S&rdquo; values in certain fields (fixed width) of a
set of files (note I did this on 22,000 files (5 Gb or so) in about 5
minutes on my desktop; it would have taken much more time to read the
data into R):</p>

<pre><code>$ cut -b29,37,45,53,61,69,77,85,93,101,109,117,125,133,141,149, \ 
        157,165,173,181,189,197,205,213,221,229,237,245,253, \
        261,269 USC*.dly | grep S | less
</code></pre>

<p>A closely related, but subtly different, capability that we saw above is
command substitution. Recall that when the shell encounters a command
surrounded by <code>$()</code> (or backticks), it runs the command and replaces the
expression with the output from the command; this allows something
similar to a pipe, but is appropriate when a command reads its arguments
directly from the command line instead of through standard input. For
example, suppose we are interested in searching for the text <code>pdf</code> in
the last 4 R code files (those with suffix <code>.r</code> or <code>.R</code>) that were
modified in the current directory. We can find the names of the four most
recently modified files ending in <code>.R</code> or <code>.r</code> using:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -t *.{R,r} | head -4
</code></pre>

<p>and we can search for the required pattern using <code>grep</code> (we will discuss
<code>grep</code> again in the section on regular expressions). Putting these
together with the backtick operator we can solve the problem using:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep pdf $(ls -t *.{R,r} | head -4)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that piping the output of the <code>ls</code> command into <code>grep</code> would not
achieve the desired goal, since <code>grep</code> reads its filenames from the
command line, not standard input.</p>

<h4>2.6.2) The <code>xargs</code> and <code>tee</code> commands</h4>

<p>You can also redirect output as the arguments to another program using
the <code>xargs</code> utility. Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -t *.{R,r} | head -4 | xargs grep pdf
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>tee</code> command lets you create two streams from one. For example,
consider the case where you want the results of this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ cut -d&#39;,&#39; -f2 cpds.csv | sort | uniq 
</code></pre>

<p>to both be output to the terminal screen you are working in as well as
being saved to a file. You could issue the command twice:</p>

<pre><code>$ cut -d&#39;,&#39; -f2 cpds.csv | sort | uniq 
$ cut -d&#39;,&#39; -f2 cpds.csv | sort | uniq &gt; countries.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of repeating the command and wasting computing time, you could
use <code>tee</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ cut -d&#39;,&#39; -f2 cpds.csv | sort | uniq | tee countries.txt
</code></pre>

<h2>3) Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>Regular expressions (regex) are a domain-specific language for finding
patterns and are one of the key functionalities in scripting languages
such as Perl and Python, as well as the UNIX utilities <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, and
<code>grep</code> as we will see below. I&#39;ll just cover the basic use of regular
expressions in bash, but once you know that, it would be easy to use
them elsewhere (Python, R, etc.). At the level we&#39;ll consider them, the
syntax is quite similar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>

<p>POSIX.2 regular expressions come in two flavors: extended regular
expressions and basic (or obsolete) regular expressions. The extended
syntax has metacharacters <code>()</code> and <code>{}</code>, while the basic syntax
requires the metacharacters to be designated <code>\(\)</code> and <code>\{\}</code>.
In addition to the POSIX standard, Perl regular expressions are also
widely used. While we won&#39;t go into detail, we will see some examples
of each syntax.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>3.1) Overview and core syntax</h3>

<p>The basic idea of regular expressions is that they allow us to find
matches of strings or patterns in strings, as well as do substitution.
Regular expressions are good for tasks such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>  extracting pieces of text - for example finding all the links in an
html document;</li>
<li>  creating variables from information found in text;</li>
<li>  cleaning and transforming text into a uniform format;</li>
<li>  mining text by treating documents as data; and</li>
<li>  scraping the web for data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regular expressions are constructed from three things:</p>

<ol>
<li> <em>Literal characters</em> are matched only by the characters themselves,</li>
<li> <em>Character classes</em> are matched by any single member in the class,
and</li>
<li> <em>Modifiers</em> operate on either of the above or combinations of them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the syntax is very concise, so it&#39;s helpful to break down
individual regular expressions into the component parts to understand
them. Since regex are their own language, it&#39;s a good idea to build up a
regex in pieces as a way of avoiding errors just as we would with any
computer code. It is also helpful to search for common regex online
before trying to craft your own. For instance, if you wanted to use a
regex that matches valid email addresses, you would need to match
anything that complies with the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt?number=822">RFC
822</a> grammar. If you
look over that document, you will quickly realize that implementing a
correct regular expression to validate email addresses is extremely
complex. So if you are writing a website that validates email addresses,
it is best to look for a bug-vetted implementation rather than creating
your own.</p>

<p>The special characters (meta-characters) used for defining regular
expressions are:</p>

<pre><code>* . ^ $ + ? ( ) [ ] { } | \
</code></pre>

<p>To use these characters literally as characters, we have to &#39;escape&#39;
them. In bash, you escape these characters by placing a single backslash
before the character you want to escape. In R, we have to use two
backslashes instead of a single backslash because R uses a single
backslash to symbolize certain control characters, such as <code>\n</code> for
newline.</p>

<h3>3.2) Character sets and character classes</h3>

<p><strong>Character sets</strong></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Operators</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>[abc]</code></td>
<td align="left">Match any single character from from the listed characters</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>[a-z]</code></td>
<td align="left">Match any single character from the range of characters</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>[^abc]</code></td>
<td align="left">Match any single character not among listed characters</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>[^a-z]</code></td>
<td align="left">Match any single character not among listed range of characters</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>.</code></td>
<td align="left">Match any single character except a <em>newline</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>\</code></td>
<td align="left">Turn off (escape) the special meaning of a metacharacter</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If we want to search for any one of a set of characters, we use a
character set, such as <code>[13579]</code> or <code>[abcd]</code> or <code>[0-9]</code> (where the dash
indicates a sequence) or <code>[0-9a-z]</code>. To indicate any character not in a
set, we place a <code>^</code> just inside the first bracket: <code>[^abcd]</code>.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of named character classes so that we don&#39;t have write
out common sets of characters. The syntax is <code>[:CLASS:]</code> where <code>CLASS</code>
is one of the following values:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;alnum&quot;, &quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;ascii&quot;, &quot;blank&quot;, &quot;cntrl&quot;, &quot;digit&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;,
&quot;lower&quot;, &quot;print&quot;, &quot;punct&quot;, &quot;space&quot;, &quot;upper&quot;, &quot;word&quot; or &quot;xdigit&quot;.
</code></pre>

<p>To learn more about regular expressions, you can type:</p>

<pre><code>$ man 7 regex
</code></pre>

<p>To make a character set with a character class you need two square
brackets, e.g. the digit class: <code>[[:digit:]]</code>. Or we can make a combined
character set such as <code>[[:alnum:]_]</code> (to find any alphabetic or numeric characters or an underscore).</p>

<h3>3.3) Location-specific matches</h3>

<p><strong>Position anchors</strong></p>

<td align="left">Match the beginning of a line.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>$</code></td>
<td align="left">Match the end of a line.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>To find a pattern at the beginning of the string, we use <code>^</code> (note this
was also used for negation, but in that case occurs only inside square
brackets) and to find it at the end we use <code>$</code>.</p>

<h3>3.4) Repetitions, Grouping, and References</h3>

<p>Now suppose I wanted to be able to detect phone numbers, email
addresses, etc. I often need to be able to deal with repetitions of
character sets.</p>

<p>I can indicate repetitions as indicated in these examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <code>[[:digit:]]*</code> – any number of digits (zero or more)</li>
<li>  <code>[[:digit:]]+</code> – at least one digit</li>
<li>  <code>[[:digit:]]?</code> – zero or one digits</li>
<li>  <code>[[:digit:]]{1,3}</code> – at least one and no more than three digits</li>
<li>  <code>[[:digit:]]{2,}</code> – two or more digits</li>
</ul>

<p>An example is that <code>\[.*\]</code> is the pattern of closed square brackets
with any number of characters (<code>.*</code>) inside.</p>

<p>We often want to be able to look for multi-character patterns. For
example, if you wanted to match phone numbers whether they start with
<code>1-</code> or not you could use the following:</p>

<pre><code>(1-)?[[:digit:]]{3}-[[:digit:]]{3}-[[:digit:]]{4}
</code></pre>

<p>The first part of the pattern <code>(1-)?</code> matches 0 or 1 occurrences of
<code>1-</code>. Then the pattern <code>[[:digit:]]{3}</code> matches any 3 digits. Similarly,
the pattern <code>[[:digit:]]{4}</code> matches any 4 digits. So the whole pattern
matches any three digits followed by <code>-</code>, then another three digits, and then followed by four
digits when it is preceded by 0 or 1 occurrences of <code>1-</code>.</p>

<p>Parentheses are also used with a pipe (<code>|</code>) to indicate any one of a set
of multi-character sequences, such as <code>(http|ftp)</code>.</p>

<h3>3.5) Greedy matching</h3>

<p>Regular expression pattern matching is <em>greedy</em>&mdash;by default, the
longest matching string is chosen.</p>

<p>Suppose we have the following file:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat file1.txt
Do an internship &lt;b&gt; in place &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; one &lt;/b&gt; course.
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to match the html tags (e.g., <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/b&gt;</code>, we might be
tempted to use the pattern <code>&lt;.*&gt;</code>. Using the <code>-o</code> option to grep, we can
have grep print out just the part of the text that the pattern matches:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -o &quot;&lt;.*&gt;&quot; file1.txt
&lt;b&gt; in place &lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt; one &lt;/b&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To get a non-greedy match, you can use the modifier <code>?</code> after the
quantifier. However, this requires that we use the Perl syntax. In order
for grep to use the Perl syntax, we need to use the <code>-P</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -P -o &quot;&lt;.*?&gt;&quot; file1.txt
&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, one can often avoid greedy matching by being more clever.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong>: How could we change our regexp to avoid the greedy
matching without using the <code>?</code> modifier? Hint: Is there some character
set that we don&#39;t want to be inside the angle brackets?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>tip</strong></p>

<p><strong>Globs vs. Regex:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Be sure you understand the difference between filename globbing
(see the Section called *Filename Globbing*) and regular
expressions. Filename globbing only works for filenames, while
regular expressions are used to match patterns in text more
generally. While they both use the same set of symbols, they mean
different things (e.g., `*` matches 0 or more characters when
globbing but matches 0 or more repetitions of the character that
precedes it when used in a regular expression).

<h3>3.6) <code>ed</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, and <code>perl</code></h3>

<p>Before the text editor, there was the line editor. Rather than
presenting you with the entire text as a text editor does, a line editor
only displays lines of text when it is requested to. The original Unix
line editor is called <code>ed</code>. You will likely never use <code>ed</code> directly, but
you will very likely use commands that are its descendants. For example,
the commands <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, and <code>vim</code> are all based directly on
<code>ed</code> (e.g., <code>grep</code> is a <code>ed</code> command that is now available as a
standalone command, while <code>sed</code> is a streaming version of <code>ed</code>) or
inherit much of its syntax (e.g., <code>awk</code> and <code>vim</code> both heavily borrow
from the <code>ed</code> syntax). Since <code>ed</code> was written when computing resources
were very constrained compared to today, this means that the syntax of
these commands can be terse. However, it also means that learning the
syntax for one of these tools will be rewarded when you need to learn
the syntax of another of these tools.</p>

<h4>3.6.1) <code>grep</code></h4>

<p>The simplest of these tools is <code>grep</code>. As I mentioned, <code>ed</code> only
displays lines of text when requested. One common task was to print all
the lines in a file matching a specific regular expression. The command
in <code>ed</code> that does this is <code>g/&lt;re&gt;/p</code>, which stands for globally match
all lines containing the regular express <code>&lt;re&gt;</code> and print them out.</p>

<p>To start you will need to create a file called <code>file1.txt</code> with the
following content:</p>

<pre><code>This is the first line.
Followed by this line.
And then ...
</code></pre>

<p>To print all the lines containing <code>is</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep is file1.txt 
This is the first line.
Followed by this line.
</code></pre>

<p>To print all the lines <strong>not</strong> containing <code>is</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -v is file1.txt 
And then ...
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&#39;s consider a file named <code>file2.txt</code> with the following content:</p>

<pre><code>Here&#39;s my number: 919-543-3300.
hi John, good to meet you
They bought 731 bananas
Please call 1.919.554.3800
I think he said it was 337.4355
</code></pre>

<p>Let&#39;s use the pattern from the section above to print all lines
containing phone numbers:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep  &#39;(1-)?[[:digit:]]{3}-[[:digit:]]{4}&#39; file2.txt
</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that this doesn&#39;t match any lines. The reason is that
the group syntax <code>(1-)</code> and the <code>{}</code> notation are not part of the
extended syntax. To have <code>grep</code> use the extended syntax, you can either
use the <code>-E</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -E &#39;(1-)?[[:digit:]]{3}-[[:digit:]]{4}&#39; file2.txt
Here&#39;s my number: 919-543-3300.
</code></pre>

<p>or use the <code>egrep</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ egrep  &#39;(1-)?[[:digit:]]{3}-[[:digit:]]{4}&#39; file2.txt
Here&#39;s my number: 919-543-3300.
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to match regardless of whether the phone number is separated
by a minus <code>-</code> or a period <code>.</code>, we could use the pattern <code>[-.]</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ egrep  &#39;(1[-.])?[[:digit:]]{3}[-.][[:digit:]]{4}&#39; file2.txt
Here&#39;s my number: 919-543-3300.
Please call 1.919.554.3800
I think he said it was 337.4355
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Explain what the following regular expression matches:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep &#39;^[^T]*is.*$&#39; file1.txt
</code></pre>

<h4>3.6.2) <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code></h4>

<p>Printing lines of text with <code>sed</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ sed -n &#39;1,9p&#39; file.txt       # prints out lines 1-9 of file.txt 
$ sed -n &#39;/^#/p&#39; file.txt       # prints out lines starting with # of file.txt 
</code></pre>

<p>The first command prints out lines 1-9 of <code>file.txt</code>, while the second
one prints out lines starting with <code>#</code> of <code>file.txt</code>.</p>

<p>Deleting lines of text with <code>sed</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ sed -e &#39;1,9d&#39; file.txt
$ sed -e &#39;/^;/d&#39; -e &#39;/^$/d&#39; file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The first line deletes lines 1-9 of <code>file.txt</code>. What do you think the
second line does?</p>

<p>Note that the -e flag is only necessary if you want to have more than one expression, so it&#39;s not actually needed in the first line.</p>

<p>Text substitution with <code>sed</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ sed &#39;s/old_pattern/new_pattern/&#39; file.txt &gt; new_file.txt
$ sed &#39;s/old_pattern/new_pattern/g&#39; file.txt &gt; new_file.txt
$ sed -i &#39;s/old_pattern/new_pattern/g&#39; file.txt 
</code></pre>

<p>The first line replaces only the first instance in a line, while the second
line replaces all instances in a line (i.e., globally). The use of the -i
flag in the third line replaces
the pattern in place in the file, thereby altering file.txt.</p>

<p>Awk is a general purpose programming language typically used in data
extraction tasks and particularly well-suited to one-liners (although it
is possible to write long programs in it, it is rare). For our purposes,
we will just look at a few common one-liners to get a sense of how it
works. Basically, awk will go through a file line by line and perform
some action for each line.</p>

<p>For example to double space a file, you would read each line, print it,
and then print a blank line:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk &#39;{ print } { print &quot;&quot; }&#39; file.txt 
</code></pre>

<p>Print every line of a file that is longer than 80 characters:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk &#39;length($0) &gt; 80&#39; file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Print the home directory of every user defined in the file
<code>/etc/passwd</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk -F: &#39;{ print $6 }&#39; /etc/passwd
</code></pre>

<p>To see what this did, let&#39;s look at the first line of <code>/etc/passwd</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ head -n 1 /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the entries are separated by colons (<code>:</code>) and the sixth
field contains the root user&#39;s home directory (<code>/root</code>). The option
<code>-F:</code> specifies that the colon <code>:</code> is the field delimiter and <code>print $6</code>
prints the 6th field of each line.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to know much <code>sed</code> or <code>awk</code>, but it is good to know about
them since you can search the internet for awk or sed one-liners. If you
have some file munging task, it can be helpful to do a quick search
before writing code to perform the task yourself.</p>

<h4>3.6.3) <code>perl</code></h4>

<p>Perl is another general-purpose programming language that is particular
useful for one-liner commands to perform data extraction and
manipulation tasks. Again even if you don&#39;t learn how to program in
Perl, it can be useful to have a couple one-liners in your toolbox.</p>

<p>Text substitution with <code>perl</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -pi -e &#39;s/old_pattern/new_pattern/g&#39; file.txt
$ perl -pi -e &#39;s/old_pattern/new_pattern/g&#39; $(find . -name \*.html)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>i</code> option tells <code>perl</code> to do the global substitution in place. You
can also substitute the <code>/</code> with another character. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -pi -e &#39;s:old_pattern:new_pattern:g&#39; file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Summing columns with <code>perl</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -lane &#39;print $F[0] + $F[1]&#39; file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This will sum columns 1 and 2 of <code>file.txt</code>.</p>

<h2>4) Processes</h2>

<p>A process is a program that is being executed. Processes have the
following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>  A lifetime.</li>
<li>  A process ID (PID).</li>
<li>  A user ID (UID).</li>
<li>  A group ID (GID).</li>
<li>  A parent process.</li>
<li>  An environment.</li>
<li>  A current working directory.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.1) Monitoring</h3>

<p>Examining subprocesses of your shell with <code>ps</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps
PID TTY          TIME CMD
19370 pts/3    00:00:00 bash
22846 pts/3    00:00:00 ps
</code></pre>

<p>Examining in more detail subprocesses of your shell with <code>ps</code>:</p>

jarrod   22850 19370  0 14:57 pts/3    00:00:00 ps -f
</code></pre>

<p>Examining in more detail all processes on your computer:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps -ef
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  0 Aug21 ?        00:00:05 /usr/lib/systemd
root         2     0  0 Aug21 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]
root         3     2  0 Aug21 ?        00:00:07 [ksoftirqd/0]
root         5     2  0 Aug21 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/0:0H]
   &lt;snip&gt;
root     16210     1  0 07:19 ?        00:00:00 login -- jarrod
jarrod   16219 16210  0 07:19 tty1     00:00:00 -bash
jarrod   16361 16219  0 07:19 tty1     00:00:00 /bin/sh /bin/startx
   &lt;snip&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the <code>-u</code> option to see percent CPU and percent memory used
by each process. You can use the <code>-o</code> option to provide your own
user-defined format; for example, :</p>

<pre><code>$ ps -o pid,ni,pcpu,pmem,user,comm
  PID  NI %CPU %MEM USER     COMMAND
18124   0  0.0  0.0 jarrod   bash
22963   0  0.0  0.0 jarrod   ps
</code></pre>

<p>To see the hierarchical process structure, you can use the <code>pstree</code>
command.</p>

<p>Examining processes with <code>top</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ top
top - 13:49:07 up  1:49,  3 users,  load average: 0.10, 0.15, 0.18

</code></pre>

<p>To quit <code>top</code>, type <code>q</code>.</p>

<h3>4.2) Signaling</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s see how to build up a command to kill firefox using some of the
tools we&#39;ve seen. First let&#39;s pipe the output of <code>ps -e</code> to <code>grep</code> to
select the line corresponding to <code>firefox</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps -e | grep firefox
16517 ?        00:10:03 firefox
</code></pre>

<p>We can now use <code>awk</code> to select the first column, which contains the
process ID corresponding to <code>firefox</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps -e | grep firefox | awk &#39;{ print $1 }&#39;
16517
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we can pipe this to the <code>kill</code> command using <code>xargs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps -e | grep firefox | awk &#39;{ print $1 }&#39; | xargs kill
</code></pre>

<h3>4.3) Job Control</h3>

<p>When you run a command in a shell by simply typing its name, you are
said to be running in the foreground. When a job is running in the
foreground, you can&#39;t type additional commands into that shell session,
but there are two signals that can be sent to the running job through
the keyboard. To interrupt a program running in the foreground, use
<code>Ctrl-c</code>; to quit a program, use <code>Ctrl-\</code>. While modern windowed systems
have lessened the inconvenience of tying up a shell with foreground
processes, there are some situations where running in the foreground is
not adequate.</p>

<p>The primary need for an alternative to foreground processing arises when
you wish to have jobs continue to run after you log off the computer. In
cases like this you can run a program in the background by simply
terminating the command with an ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>). However, before putting
a job in the background, you should consider how you will access its
results, since <em>stdout</em> is not preserved when you log off from the
computer. Thus, redirection (including redirection of <em>stderr</em>) is
essential when running jobs in the background. As a simple example,
suppose that you wish to run an R script, and you don&#39;t want it to
terminate when you log off. (Note that this can also be done using
<code>R CMD BATCH</code>, so this is primarily an illustration.)</p>

<pre><code>$ R --no-save &lt; code.R &gt; code.Rout 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>If you forget to put a job in the background when you first execute it,
you can do it while it&#39;s running in the foreground in two steps. First,
suspend the job using the <code>Ctrl-z</code> signal. After receiving the signal,
the program will interrupt execution, but will still have access to all
files and other resources. Next, issue the <code>bg</code> command, which will
start the stopped job running in the background.</p>

<h4>4.3.1) Listing and killing jobs</h4>

<p>Since only foreground jobs will accept signals through the keyboard, if
you want to terminate a background job you must first determine the
unique process id (PID) for the process you wish to terminate through
the use of the <code>ps</code> command.</p>

<p>To see all processes owned by a specific user (e.g., <code>jarrod</code>), I can
use the <code>-U jarrod</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps -U jarrod
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to get more information (e.g., <code>%CPU</code> and <code>%MEM</code>), I can use
add the <code>-u</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps -U jarrod -u
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START    TIME COMMAND
jarrod   16116 12.0  6.0 118804  5080 tty1     Ss   16:25  133:01 python
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the <code>ps</code> output tells us that this python job has a PID
of <code>16116</code>, that it has been running for 133 minutes, is using 12% of
CPU and 6% of memory, and that it started at 16:25. You could then issue
the command:</p>

<pre><code>$ kill 11998
</code></pre>

<p>or, if that doesn&#39;t work:</p>

<pre><code>$ kill -9 11998
</code></pre>

<p>to terminate the job. Another useful command in this regard is
<code>killall</code>, which accepts a program name instead of a process id, and
will kill all instances of the named program:</p>

<pre><code>$ killall R
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, it will only kill the jobs that belong to you, so it will not
affect the jobs of other users. Note that the <code>ps</code> and <code>kill</code> commands
only apply to the particular computer on which they are executed, not to
the entire computer network. Thus, if you start a job on one machine,
you must log back into that same machine in order to manage your job.</p>

<h4>4.3.2) Monitoring jobs and memory use</h4>

<p>As we saw above, the <code>top</code> command also allows you to monitor the jobs
on the system and in real-time. In particular, it&#39;s useful for seeing
how much of the CPU and how much memory is being used, as well as
figuring out a PID as an alternative to <code>ps</code>. You can also renice jobs
(see below) and kill jobs from within top: just type <code>r</code> or <code>k</code>,
respectively, and proceed from there.</p>

<p>One of the main things to watch out for is a job that is using close to
100% of memory and much less than 100% of CPU. What is generally
happening is that your program has run out of memory and is using
virtual memory on disk, spending most of its time writing to/from disk,
sometimes called <em>paging</em> or <em>swapping</em>. If this happens, it can be a
very long time, if ever, before your job finishes.</p>

<h4>4.3.3) Nicing a job</h4>

<p>The most important thing to remember when starting a job on a machine
that is not your personal machine is how to be a good citizen. This
often involves &#39;nicing&#39; your jobs. Nicing a job puts it at a lower
priority so that a user working at the keyboard has higher priority in
using the CPU. Here&#39;s how to do it, giving the job a low priority of 19:</p>

<pre><code>$ nice -19 R CMD BATCH --no-save code.R code.Rout &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>If you forget and just submit the job without nicing, you can reduce the
priority by doing:</p>

<pre><code>$ renice +19 11998
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>11998</code> is the PID of your job.</p>

<h4>4.3.4) Screen</h4>

<p>Screen allows you to create virtual terminals, which are not connected
to your actual terminal or shell. This allows you to run multiple
programs from the commandline and leave them all in the foreground in
their own virtual terminal. Screen provides facilities for managing
several virtual terminals including listing them, switching between
them, disconnecting from one machine and then reconnecting from another.
While we will only discuss its basic operation, we will cover enough to
be of regular use.</p>

<p>Calling screen :</p>

<pre><code>$ screen
</code></pre>

<p>will open a single window and you will see a new bash prompt. You just
work at this prompt as you normally would. The difference is that you
can disconnect from this window by typing <code>Ctrl-a d</code> and you will see
something like this :</p>

<pre><code>$ screen
[detached from 23974.pts-2.t430u]
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>tip</strong></p>

<p>All the screen key commands begin with the control key combination
<code>Ctrl-a</code> followed by another key. For instance, when you are in a
screen session and type <code>Ctrl-a ?</code>, screen will display a help screen
with a list of its keybindings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can now list your screen sessions :</p>

<pre><code>$ screen -ls 
There is a screen on:
        23974.pts-2.t430u       (Detached)
</code></pre>

<p>To reconnect :</p>

<pre><code>$ screen -r
</code></pre>

<p>You can start multiple screen sessions. This is what it might look like
if you have 3 screen sessions:</p>

<pre><code>$ screen -ls 
There are screens on:
        24274.pts-2.t430u       (Attached)
        24216.pts-2.t430u       (Detached)
        24158.pts-2.t430u       (Detached)
</code></pre>

<p>To specify that you want to reattach to session <code>24158.pts-2.t430u</code>,
type:</p>

<pre><code>$ screen -r 24158.pts-2.t430u
</code></pre>

<p>If you have several screen sessions, you will want to name your screen
session something more informative than <code>24158.pts-2.t430u</code>. To name a
screen session <code>gene-analysis</code> you can use the <code>-S</code> option when calling
screen:</p>

<pre><code>$ screen -S gene-analysis
</code></pre>

<p>While there are many more features and keybindings available for screen,
you&#39;ve already seen enough screen to be useful. For example, imagine you
ssh to a remote machine from your laptop to run an analysis. The first
thing you do at the bash prompt on the remote machine is:</p>

<pre><code>$ screen -S dbox-study
</code></pre>

<p>Then you start your analysis script <code>dbox-analysis.py</code> running:</p>

<pre><code>$ dbox-analysis.py
Starting statistical analysis ...
Processing subject 1 ...
Processing subject 2 ...
</code></pre>

<p>If your study has 50 subjects and processing each subject takes 20
minutes, you will not want to sit there watching your monitor. So you
use <code>Ctrl-a d</code> to detach the session and you will then see:</p>

<pre><code>$ screen -S dbox-study
[detached from 2799.dbox-study]
$
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can log off your laptop and go home. Sometime after dinner, you
decide to check on your job. So you ssh from your home computer to the
remote machine again and type the following at the bash prompt:</p>

<pre><code>$ screen -r dbox-study
</code></pre>

<h2>5) Shell programming</h2>

<p>Shell scripts are files containing shell commands (commonly with the
extension <code>.sh</code>) To run a shell script called <code>file.sh</code>, you would type
:</p>

<pre><code>$ source ./file.sh
</code></pre>

<p>or :</p>

<pre><code>$ . ./file.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you just typed <code>file.sh</code>, the operating system will
generally have trouble finding the script and recognizing that it is
executable. To be sure that the operating system knows what shell to use
to interpret the script, the first line of the script should be
<code>#!/bin/bash</code> (in the case that you&#39;re using the bash shell). Also, if
you set <code>file.sh</code> to be executable (i.e., to have the &#39;x&#39; flag set) you
can execute it by just typing <code>./file.sh</code>.</p>

<h3>5.1) Functions</h3>

<p>You can define your own utilities by creating a shell function. This
allows you to automate things that are more complicated than you can do
with an alias. One nice thing about shell functions is that the shell
automatically takes care of function arguments for you. It places the
arguments given by the user into local variables in the function called
(in order): <code>$1 $2 $3</code> etc. It also fills <code>$#</code> with the number of
arguments given by the user. Here&#39;s an example of using arguments in a
function that saves me some typing when I want to copy a file to the SCF
filesystem:</p>

<pre><code>function putscf() {
   scp $1 jarrod@scf-ug02.berkeley.edu:$2 
}
</code></pre>

<p>To use this function, I just do the following to copy <code>unit1.pdf</code> from
the current directory on whatever non-SCF machine I&#39;m on to the
directory <code>~/teaching/243</code> on SCF:</p>

<pre><code>$ putscf unit1.pdf ~/teaching/243/.
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you&#39;d want to put such functions in your <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>

<h3>5.2) If/then/else</h3>

<p>We can use if-then-else type syntax to control the flow of a shell
script. For an example, here is a shell function <code>niceR()</code> that can be
used for nicing R jobs:</p>

<pre><code># niceR shortcut for nicing R jobs 
# usage: niceR inputRfile outputRfile 
# Author: Brian Caffo 
# Date: 10/01/03 

function niceR(){
    # submits nice&#39;d R jobs
    if [ $# != &quot;2&quot; ]; then
         echo &quot;usage: niceR inputRfile outputfile&quot; 
    elif [ -e &quot;$2&quot; ]; then
         echo &quot;$2 exists, I won&#39;t overwrite&quot; 
    elif [ ! -e &quot;$1&quot; ]; then
         echo &quot;inputRfile $1 does not exist&quot; 
    else
         echo &quot;running R on $1&quot; 
         nice -n 19 R --no-save &lt; $1 &amp;&gt; $2
    fi
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>then</code> is on a separate line from the <code>if</code>, you won&#39;t need the semicolon. </p>

<p>For more details, look in Newham&amp;Rosenblatt or search online.</p>

<h3>5.3) For loops</h3>

<p><em>for</em> loops in shell scripting are primarily designed for iterating
through a set of files or directories. Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<pre><code>for file in $(ls *.txt)  
do
   mv $file ${file/.txt/.R}
   # this syntax replaces .txt with .R in $file``
done
</code></pre>

<p>Another use of <em>for</em> loops is automating file downloads:</p>

<pre><code># example of bash for loop and wget for downloading a collection of files on the web
# usage: ./forloopDownload.sh
# Author: Chris Paciorek
# Date: July 28, 2011

url=&#39;ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/grid/years&#39;
types=&quot;tmin tmax&quot;
for ((yr=1950; yr&lt;=2017; yr++))
do
    for type in ${types}
    do
        wget ${url}/${yr}.${type}
    done
done
</code></pre>

<p><em>for</em> loops are very useful for starting a series of jobs:</p>

<pre><code># example of bash for loop for starting jobs
# usage: ./forloopJobs.sh
# Author: Chris Paciorek
# Date: July 28, 2011

n=100 
for(( it=1; it&lt;=100; it++ ))
do
    echo &quot;n=$n; it=$it; source(&#39;base.R&#39;)&quot; &gt; tmp-$n-$it.R
    R CMD BATCH --no-save tmp-$n-$it.R sim-n$n-it$it.Rout
done
# note that base.R should NOT set either &#39;n&#39; or &#39;it&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Note by default the separator when you&#39;re looping through elements of a variable will be a space (as above), but you can set it differently, for example:</p>

<pre><code>IFS=:
types=tmin:tmax:pmin:pmax
for type in $types
do
    echo $type
done
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly to the if/then/else, if you have the <code>do</code> on the same line as the <code>for</code>, you&#39;ll need a semicolon before the <code>do</code>.</p>

<h3>5.4) How much shell scripting should I learn?</h3>

<p>We&#39;ve covered most of what you are likely to need to know about the
shell. I tend to only use bash scripts for simple tasks that require
only a few lines of bash commands and very little control flow (i.e.,
conditional statements, loops). For more complicated OS tasks, it is
often preferable to use Python. You can also do a fair amount of what
you need from within R using the <code>system()</code> function. This will enable
you to avoid dealing with a lot of shell programming syntax (but you&#39;ll
still need to know how to use UNIX utilities, wildcards, and pipes to be
effective).</p>

<h2>6) Working with documents</h2>

<p>There are many plain text file formats (e.g., markdown,
reStructuredText, LaTeX). Pandoc is a widely used document converter. To
convert a file written in markdown (<code>report.md</code>) to a PDF
(<code>report.pdf</code>), you would do something like:</p>

<pre><code>$ pandoc -o report.pdf report.md
</code></pre>

<p>For a quick introduction to LaTeX, please see the &ldquo;Introduction to
LaTeX&rdquo; tutorial and screencast here:

use this to look for anomalies in a CSV file.)</p></li>
<li><p>Write shell code that creates files <code>file1.txt</code>, <code>file2.txt</code>,
<code>file3.txt</code>, etc., with the word &#39;blah&#39; as the only line in each
file.</p></li>
<li><p>Write shell code that modifies each file from the previous problem
so that the number <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, etc. is prepended to the
appropriate file (i.e., there is a new first line in each file that
simply contains the number corresponding to the file name).</p>
